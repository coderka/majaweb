If you’ve decided to build your own website, you may already know that you’ll need a web developer 
to make sure the technical side of your new website comes together smoothly.

But what skills should you look for in a web developer? And do you need a web developer or 
a web designer — is there a difference?

Here’s a closer look at the specific skills and talents your web person should have, 
so you can identify what you’re looking for and better understand what web-related 
skills are needed to build the best site for you or your business.
What is a web developer?

A web developer is a programmer who creates programs and applications for the World Wide Web. 
A web developer knows how to build a website from the bottom up: they can create custom code 
to accommodate your unique needs, developing everything from the site layout to features and functions 
on the webpage.
What does a web developer do?

Web development can be divided into three parts:

    Client-side scripting, which is code that executes in a web browser and determines what your 
	customers or clients will see when they land on your website.
    Server-side scripting, which is code that executes on a web server and powers 
	the behind-the-scenes mechanics of how a website works.
    Database technology, which also helps keep a website running smoothly.

A web developer is typically tasked with building a website from the ground up, using skills in 
one or more of these three areas.

In fact, large-scale web projects often divide these tasks among multiple web developers: 
one developer may focus on setting up the back end of a site while another focuses on the client 
side to add style and functionality to the website itself.

The advantage of building a website from the ground up is that you can create something original 
that fits your specific needs.

<em>Skills to look for in a web developer</em>

It’s easiest to look at a web developer description by splitting the skills into the three areas 
mentioned above: client-side languages, server-side languages and database technologies.
Client-side languages

Client-side scripting refers to the creation of web applications that execute themselves within 
the browser of a user’s computer, like storing user data in cookies, simple flash games, or other 
forms of interactive web applications. This also includes using languages like HTML, CSS or JavaScript 
to build the layout, look and feel of a website.

<em>Here are some examples of client-side languages:</em>

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    Flash
    JQuery
    Microsoft Silverlight

<em>Server-side languages</em>

Server-side scripting is a technique used by web developers to build the backend of a website.

Why is that so critical for your new site? A web browser’s storage is limited by the end user’s 
computer (i.e. the person using the website), so websites need to host the files and images that 
make the site work in a database on a web server.

Server-side scripting involves constructing the framework that allows the database on the web 
server to communicate with the web browser of the end user’s computer. To make it work, the 
developer embeds scripts in your website so that, when someone using your site takes a particular 
action, the server can display set images or information. Server-side code is also inherently 
more secure, as the person using your website has no direct access to source code, proprietary 
databases or data beyond what’s specifically shown to them.

The following are examples of server-side languages:

    ASP.NET
    C
    Java
    PHP
    Python
    Ruby

<em>Database technologies</em>

The final set of skills to look for in a web developer is the database technologies 
they are familiar with. In order to work properly, every website needs a database to store 
its code, images, files and other data.

These relational database management systems (RDBMS) are the most popular for web-based 
applications:

    Oracle
    Microsoft SQL Server
    MySQL
    IBM DB2
    Apache
    MongoDB

<em>Web Designer vs. Web Developer</em>

The line between web designer and web developer is often blurred because there is a lot of overlap.

Generally speaking, a web designer’s focus is the look and feel of a website; 
a web developer focuses on the technical side of things. However, a developer 
who does client-side programming will have a direct impact on the look, layout and feel of a website. 
Because of this, web designers and web developers will often both know HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

For larger-scale web projects, however, the distinction is often much more defined:

    A web designer will use graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign 
	to create the logos, graphics and layout that determine the look and feel of a website.
    The web developer will still have to understand the aesthetics and art direction of the web 
	designer if they are handling client-side scripts, but they will be more concerned 
	with functionality and features, like the shopping cart on an ecommerce website.

You need both skillsets in order to build a proper website, and often a designer may not 
even have to write the code. In this case, a graphic designer will create a visual 
representation of the website’s layout while the web developer will use code to make 
the layout a reality.

Still other web professionals have honed their skills in both disciplines:

    For a web designer, knowing how to code can help them communicate better with the web development team.
    For a web developer, understanding the art direction of a website can help them write better code.

Someone who has mastered both can make an excellent project manager, offering a perfect mix of form 
and function to a web project.</pre>

A website template is basically a premade webpage — or set of 
webpages — that can be customized with images, videos and other 
style elements to create a complete website.

Often created by web developers, the template includes 
everything needed (i.e. HTML, CSS, and any other code required) 
for it to function.

<em>How to build a website using templates</em>

The website design process is greatly simplified when you pair 
a template with a popular web template system like WordPress 
or Joomla. Instead of having to understand the technical 
aspects of web design, most of the setup is practically 
automated: with the click of a button you can install 
website templates, called “themes,” then customize them 
to your liking without having to write a single line of code.

There are also many plugins and apps available 
on the Internet that allow you to add additional 
functionality to your website, like improving 
search engine optimization (SEO), boosting your 
social media marketing, or strengthening the 
overall security of your blog.

Before you start randomly downloading great-looking 
web templates, it is important to note that you need 
more than a template to build a website: you need a 
place to put it.

<em>Here’s how to get started:</em>

1.Register your domain name.
2.Find a webhosting service. While you can 
also choose a different provider, you can 
often purchase webhosting through the same 
company as your domain name.
3.Install a content management system (CMS) 
like WordPress or Joomla on your webhost’s server. 
Many webhosts offer several CMSs to choose from, 
with easy DIY setup.
4.Find, download and install a website template. 
There are many templates available for free, 
or you can purchase one for a fee; 
choose the template that fits your particular needs and budget.
5.Replace generic content and logos with your own 
images and words.
6.Install additional features like shopping carts, 
galleries, search engine optimization plugins and other apps.
